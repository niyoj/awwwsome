//Here, 7 in 1 SASS Architecture is followed for creating manageable codebase. 
//    * `abstracts`, contains SCSS that would not appear as css like mixins, functions, and variables.
//    * `base`, contatins boilerplate SCSS used through entire site,
//    * `components`, are buliding blocks of the webpage
//    * `layouts`, contains SCSS for structural component of site,
//    * `pages`, contains page-specific SCSS,
//    * `themes`, contains SCSS for different themes
//    * `vendors`, will have third party stylesheets needed in the project.
